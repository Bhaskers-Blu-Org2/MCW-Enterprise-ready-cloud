# Enterprise-ready cloud
Trey Research is a manufacturing company that builds consumer products with 29.6 billion USD in annual revenue. Trey's headquarters are in New Jersey, but they have data centers and branch offices scattered across the United States with several major offices in the United Kingdom, France, and Japan.

Even as large as it is, Trey seeks to maximize the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of its IT, especially in new projects and business units. With a dizzying number of existing business units, each with their own unique requirements from IT and ballooning costs from internal hardware and data center investment, Trey is looking to the cloud.

Trey is interested in a large-scale solution that will help mitigate creeping costs and start the transition to a modern cloud-based enterprise architecture using a solid set of controls for governance. 

## Target audience
-	Infrastructure architect

## Abstract

### Workshop
Create an Azure cloud governance plan to advise a manufacturing company of the features available in Azure. Discover features to bring governance to their Azure deployments, distributed administration, and allowance for secure remote connectivity and development work for their offshore developers. Attendees will be better able to design a governance plan to showcase the security and governance features of Azure and control costs. In addition,

-   Provide for cost tracking by business unit, environment, and project
-   Provide for a distributed administration model
-   Put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services
-   Put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions

### Whiteboard Design Session
In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to design a comprehensive solution to address concerns about security, charge back, tagging and other areas to help apply an enterprise governance model for Trey Research.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a governance plan to showcase the security and governance features of Azure and control costs. In addition,

-   Provide for cost tracking by business unit, environment, and project
-   Provide for a distributed administration model
-   Put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services
-   Put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions

### Hands-on Lab
In this hands-on lab, you are working with Trey Research to setup some best practices regarding policies, permissions, and remote access to their network. Some tasks will include creating scripts that Enterprise IT will use to automatically set policy and delegate permissions when a new subscription is created. You will also help them solve a critical problem for on-boarding new developers and controlling access to what they can access on the network.

Additionally, you will know how to: 
-   Provide for cost tracking by business unit, environment, and project
-   Provide for a distributed administration model
-   Put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services
-   Put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions
